# Face-Recognition

I have used HAAR as well as LBP classifier to train our model.
After training on 12 image each of the two different candidate i got the result as follows on the test images.

It is found out that HAAR is slow but more accurate where as LBP is faster but little less accurate. There is a trade of between time and accuracy.
